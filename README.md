Original bio:

### Hi there, I'm verarr ðŸ‘‹ ###

- ðŸ§’ I'm a child.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on several projects and I'm still learning stuff.
- ðŸ‘¯ I don't think I'm ready to collaborate to anything **yet**... 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **she/her** or any (I don't really care)
- ðŸ“« If - for whatever reason - you'd like to message me, you can send an email to my [listed email address](mailto:verarr@fvnki.town) or DM `@verarr` on Discord (if you can) (please don't, i'll get a panic attack).
<!-- I thought I'd drop the 'Ã©'
- ðŸ’¬ My username could look like a real name to some people, but it's actually all made up. You can ignore the accented *e* and call me *Verarr* if you can't type *Ã©* easily.
